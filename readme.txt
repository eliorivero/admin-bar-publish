Extends Admin Bar by allowing to publish or draft from the front end.

== Description ==

This Plugin extends the Admin Bar by adding a button that allows to publish an entry from the front end.
If the entry is already published, the button functionality changes to allow to switch it to a draft.

Publishing the post not only changes the post status from 'draft' to 'publish'. It will run all the actions associated with publishing as if you were doing it in the WP Admin side.
